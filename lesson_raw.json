One day,\nwhen the queen was bathing in the lake, a frog jumped out of the water and said, “Before\nthe end of this year, your wish to have a baby will be granted.”\nA few days later the prediction of the frog came true and the Queen gave birth to\na beautiful baby girl and she decided to have a grand christening ceremony. They have\nnot only invited their relatives and friends, but also invited the twelve good fairies to be\ngodmothers. However, there were thirteen fairies in the land, but the king had forgotten\nthe thirteenth as she lived alone faraway in a castle and she was not invited. That proved\na grave mistake for the King and Queen and they soon realized their mistake.\nThe christening was held grandly and when it was almost over, the good fairies went\nup to the cradle and bestowed gifts on the baby. One gave her gift of virtue, another, beauty\nand another, wealth and the baby Princess had all the gifts. When the eleventh fairy had\nbestowed her gift, the thirteenth fairy came and said, “I am going to give her a gift which\nwill never allow her to forget me.” She shouted and wailed, “On her sixteenth birthday,\nthe Princess will prick herself with a spindle and will die.”\nReading\n52 \tEnglish-4",
