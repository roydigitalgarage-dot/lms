=== THE STORY ===

Long, long ago, there lived a king and a queen who longed for a baby. One day, when the queen was bathing in the lake, a frog jumped out of the water and said, "Before the end of this year, your wish to have a baby will be granted."

A few days later the prediction of the frog came true and the Queen gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and she decided to have a grand christening ceremony. They have not only invited their relatives and friends, but also invited the twelve good fairies to be godmothers. However, there were thirteen fairies in the land, but the king had forgotten the thirteenth as she lived alone faraway in a castle and she was not invited. That proved a grave mistake for the King and Queen and they soon realized their mistake.

The christening was held grandly and when it was almost over, the good fairies went up to the cradle and bestowed gifts on the baby. One gave her gift of virtue, another, beauty and another, wealth and the baby Princess had all the gifts. When the eleventh fairy had bestowed her gift, the thirteenth fairy came and said, "I am going to give her a gift which will never allow her to forget me." She shouted and wailed, "On her sixteenth birthday, the Princess will prick herself with a spindle and will die."

All the members were dumbstruck but the twelfth fairy came and as she had the power to lift the wicked curse, she eased it saying, "Take comfort. The Princess won't die, but falls into deep sleep for hundred years when she pricks her finger on the spindle."

The king ordered all the spindles to be banned and burnt as the hope that he would save his daughter from the magic spell of the thirteenth fairy. He regretted not inviting her to the christening.

The years flew and the princess grew up to be kind and beautiful and was loved by all. On her sixteenth birthday her parents were away for part of the day. So the princess was alone for most of the day.

She wandered all over the palace and had a look at all the places where she had never been before. Finally, she came to a winding staircase which led to a tower. She climbed up the staircase and reached a little door with a rusty key in the lock. When she turned it, the door opened and she found an old woman busily spinning flax on a spindle.

The old woman greeted her and invited her. The princess asked her, "What are you doing?" The old woman replied, "I'm spinning yarn." The princess then asked, "What is that thing that is jumping up and down?". "That's a spindle," replied the old woman, "Will you try it?" The princess took the spindle and began to spin.

As soon as she touched the spindle, she fell asleep. The whole palace along with her parents who have just arrived also fell asleep. There was not even the rustle of the dry leaf as everybody and everything have slept peacefully.

A hedge of thorns grew up around the palace. Every year the hedge grew higher and thicker and eventually the flag on the palace roof could no longer be seen.

The story of the sleeping beauty became a legend in that land. From time to time princes went to cut the thorns, but they failed in their attempts. So almost all of them gave up the idea of searching for the Sleeping Beauty.

After a hundred years, a prince heard about the story of the Sleeping Beauty. He knew about the attempts of the other princes who have failed and he thought, "I want to go and find the lovely Sleeping Beauty for myself," saying so he rode to the hedge of thorns and a mysterious thing happened.

When he was about to cut the wild hedge of thorns a path opened up, and the prince rode straight into the palace. The wild thorns closed up to form a hedge once more.

The prince saw the horses, dogs, birds asleep. He looked around and saw the king and queen also fast asleep.

Finally, he came to the tower and opened the door to the little room where the princess lay sleeping. She looked so beautiful that he bent down to kiss her on the lips. As his lips touched hers, the Sleeping Beauty awoke and fell in love with the prince at first sight.

The rest of the palace awoke after their long sleep. It seemed as though time had stood still and those long, long years had never passed.

The spell was lifted at last and the darkest days were finished. Soon everyone enjoyed the magnificent Wedding Reception of Sleeping Beauty. The prince and the Sleeping Beauty lived happily thereafter. No one ever saw or heard about that troublesome thirteenth fairy.
